# Spider-Animation

School Project using OpenGL to design a 3D spider model which allows user to control every joint

User interface for the example program is provided through mouse buttons and keyboard:

    1, 2, 3, 4, 5 keys: toggles which fingers are active for rotation (1=thumb, 5=pinky)

    P, M, D key: selects which joint is active P=joint of finger with palm, M=middle joint, D=last (distal) joint

    X, Y, Z: set current rotation axis to x, y, or z axis

    Up-arrow, down-arrow: change the angle at the active joints

    Left mouse button click and drag motion: change the viewing angle

    R key: reset the viewing angle

    Q key: quit

    A, B, C, D: toggle which of the scorpion's RIGHT legs are active for rotation

    a, b, c, d: toggle which of the scorpion's left legs are active for rotation

    F/f: toggles when the RIGHT/left front claws are active for rotation

    P: toggles when the tail is active for rotation

    1,2,...: toggle which of the joints are active for rotation.

    X, Y, Z: set current rotation axis to x, y, or z axis for rotation

    Up-arrow, down-arrow: change the angle at the active joints

    Left mouse button (click and drag motion): change the viewing angle

    O: outputs the angle values for all the joints in the scorpion

    T: cycles through test poses for demo

    R: resets the model and the viewing angle

    Q: quits
